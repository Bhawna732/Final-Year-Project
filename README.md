# Final-Year-Project
A hybrid clustering algorithm combining Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with Fuzzy C-Means, enhanced via entropy-based smarter adaptive reduction (E-SAPR) to improve clustering quality and efficiency. Includes original and modified PSO code with entropy control, population reduction, and performance comparison.
